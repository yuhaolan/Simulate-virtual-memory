# Simulate-virtual-memory
•This program consists of writing a program that translates logical to physical address for a virtual address space of size 2^16. The goal behind this project is to simulate the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses.  
•Your program will read from a file containing logical addresses and, using a TLB as well as a page table, will translate each logical address to its corresponding physical address and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.
